Place holder - %s-string, %d-integer
name = "Abhi"
age = 25
age = "%s is %d year old"
age%(name,age)

lists: comma separated values
Indexing starts from 0
shopList = ["Appels", "Bananas", "Oranges"]
shopList.append["Cherry"] - Appends value at end of the list
del shopList[2] - deletes the value at that index
len(shopList) - gives length of list
max(shopList)
min(shopList)
can use arthmatic operations like +(to append two lists) and *(to multiply the contents)

Dictionary - variable = {"key":value, "key1":value1}
students = {"Abhi":25, "Valli":23, "Raju":52}
students["Abhi"]
>>> 25
len, del arthmatic +,* works asusual

Tuple - sequence lists, immutable
tup = ("appels", "bananas", "cherry")
cannot delete or add
len, del arthmatic +,* works asusual

ConditionalStatements 
if else loop: maintain if, elif, else in line order
if(condition):
	statement
shft+tab
elif (condition1):
	statement1
shft+tab
else:
	statement1

for loop:
list = ["Appels", "Bananas", "Oranges"]
for item in list:
	print(item)
for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)  //resut is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
for i in range(1,11,2):
	print(i)  //result is 0 2 4 6 8 10 here '2' is increment factor
	
while loop:
while condition:
	statement
	increment

break: breaks the loop
continue: skips the iteration
pass: filler, has nothing to do

try and exception
try:
	statementA
except:
	statementB

Functions
def funName():
	print("HelloWorld")
def greet(name):
	print("Hi " + name + "..!")
	
def add(num1, num2):
	return(num1+num2)

sum = add(2,3)  //sum=3

InBuiltFunctions - py
abs( ) gives positive num
bool( ) bool(None)=bool(0) is False
dir("string") gives all py has to do with
help( )
eval( ) runs like its a single line py code
exec( ) runs like its a multi line py code
str( ) converts into string
float( )
int( )

OOP
class person:
	def __init__(self,name,age)
		self.name=name
		self.age=age
	def getName(self):
		print("your name is " + self.name)
	def.getAge(self):
		print("Your age is "  self.age)
p = person("Abhi","25")
p.getName()
p.getAge()
